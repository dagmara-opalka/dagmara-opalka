## Hi there 👋
Welcome to my GitHub portfolio. Please make yourself at home among my repositories and take a look at what I'm working on :)
<br>
<br>Here are some facts about me:
<br>💻I am a <b>software tester</b> with 6 years of experience who decided to learn <b>frontend development</b>. In my repository, you will find both test automation projects and HTML!
<br>🤓I enjoy learning new things, whether it's crocheting or programming—currently, I'm learning frontend development under the guidance of <b>my mentor</b> [DevMentor.pl](https://www.linkedin.com/school/devmentor-pl/posts/?feedView=all)
<br>🐱 Personally, I’m a cat person. I enjoy yoga, hiking, and video games
